Simple directions on how to use the program:

Install imagemagick++ on your (hopefully linux based) computer

To do so use apt-get

sudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing

sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev

if you can type Magick++-config and get a response other than an error 
YOU GOT IT!

Now if you want to run the program make sure to use c++ in the following way

g++ -O2 -fopenmp -o <outputfile name> <file-name.cpp> `Magick++-config 
--cppflags --cxxflags --ldflags --libs`

notice that that is a capital O2 not a zero 2


You can also simply go to the directory where the program you want to run is located and copy the 
compiler.sh script and type:

./compiler.sh

to compile the program.  (NOTE: you may need to change the name of the program within the .sh file)
