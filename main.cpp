/* Main program to call the functions for each image filter.  This expects no parameters and uses user input and output to 
help the user make their selection.  The program consists of 2-3 parts:
	part 1: Show the user they have entered the editor, and show the possible selections
	part 2: Based on the user's selection, it shows them their selection, then prints all the images in their image directory
	(which I am assuming are the possible choices), and then asks for the user to select a given image.
	part 3: based on the selected image a function is called to do the selected filter.

	Thats as far as I've gotten so far.


	SIDE NOTE:  Right now this only runs on Unix based systems, since we will be using nrs-projects it will work, I haven't tested it
	on my mac but all you would have to change is the directory that the ls command is stored in (if it is stores somewhere different),
	it also assumes that the folder you are storing the images in are in ~/Dropbox/Project.  If you want to run it on your computers then
	just change the directory.

	**I cant get it to return the right string and I'm bored and hungry Ill fix it later.


	Program: Main program (calls subfunctions)
	Author:David Dvorak, Shaun Piazza
	Purpose:allows user input to select an input file, a filter, and whether or not it should run parallel
